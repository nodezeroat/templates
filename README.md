# LosTemplates - CTF Challenge Templates

Preconfigured CTF challenge templates with sane defaults and an homogeneous
interface. Instanced web, instanced qemu+ssh, jailed pwn, sagemath, and much
more.

No heavy dependencies, no precompiled binaries, no sketchy registries. Just
coreutils, containers, shells and makefiles. Easily auditable, verifiable and
extendable, both for authors and players.

Automatically handle deployments with registry (kubernetes), compose (docker)
or systemd services (quadlets). Generate distribution files, local player
deployments, and CTFd metadata yaml files automatically with no extra effort.

Harmonized interface for all challenges. Run `make` to run, `make solve` to
solve, and other targets: `dist`,`test`,`lint`,`deploy`, etc. Configurable via
arguments: `make PORT=8080`, `make solve HOST=chall.losfuzzys.net`, and more.
Different deployments? `source .env-release`. Keep it simple.

Multiple alternatives, fast actions. Kubernetes cluster down? Cloud rate
limits? Quickly ssh into a VPS and run `make deploy-docker`. Problems? Run
`make HOST=0.0.0.0`. Your infrastructure team will have an easier time fixing
Kubernetes.

## Guidelines

All the template logic is implemented in the `Makefile` at the root of every
template folder. This `Makefile` holds metadata configuration that authors can
change. The name of the challenge will be the name of the folder holding the
`Makefile` (by default).

Files in `challenge/` hold the main challenge logic. `challenge/flag.txt`
contains the flag. `challenge/Dockerfile` runs the challenge container and
`challenge/entrypoint.sh` contains the entrypoint of the container. For
challenges with a build step, `challenge/Makefile` is run to build the
challenge.

Files in `dist/` will be packaged for the `.tar.gz` distributed file. Use
symlinks if the file should stay the same, and make a copy with modifications
if you need to redact or change parts of the file. See, for example, how
`dist/flag.txt` is not a symlink. Symlinks will be resolved before packaging. 

Files in `solution/` holds the solvescript and writeup for the challenge.
Dependencies for `solution/exploit` can be added via `uv` in
`solution/requirements.txt` or `apt install` in `solution/Dockerfile`.

### Development Recommendations

**Modifying the Makefile:**

Authors and organizers can edit the top level `Makefile` from a challenge in
order to add required functionality for their CTF. In this case, we recommend
changing the version label as `-GLACIERCTF25`. This way you can compare against
it in automated testing scripts, in case it requires non-standard handling due
to changes made to the `Makefile`.

**Buffering for pwn:**

We don't recommend disabling the buffering at the `entrypoint.sh` for C
programs, it usually `LD_PRELOAD`s the binary and causes unexpected
allocations, likely breaking locally developed heap exploits. Always disable it
in the program `main` or init function with `man 3 setvbuf`.

**Creating a writeable path:**

For jailed apps you can create a writeable path with `nsjail`, see
`*-jail-*/challenge/Dockerfile`:

```
# add "-m none:/DESTPATH:tmpfs:size=N" before --cwd on nsjail args to have a tmpfs-backed writable DESTPATH of N bytes
# remember that /DESTPATH cannot contain any files coming from /jail (as its a mount). If you want 
# pre-created/copied files in /DESTPATH you should manually copy them in entrypoint.sh
# Note: /DESTPATH should not contain /jail as a prefix
```

### Deployment Recommendations

**Default deployment:**

Adjust the default deployment target to the inteded one for release. You can
also change it to deploy to a testing instance and place authentication
credentials in `deployment/` (in case team is trusted).

**Flag:**

Change the flag format in `challenge/flag.txt`, `dist/flag.txt` and
`solution/exploit`. You can write a sed script that does it, in case you want
to pull changes from upstream frequently.

## Contributing

We welcome every contribution to the project. You can check for issues and open
a PR. Feel free to implement new features, but we recommend opening an issue
for discussion before implementing it :)

## FAQ

**Why not an nsjail config:**

This way we can easily control it via enviroment variables if needed, also, the
less infrastructure-related files in `challenge/`, the better for players that
don't care about them. You need to change something about the "runtime" system?
Must be in `challenge/Dockerfile`! You need to change the entrypoint? Must be
`challenge/entrypoint.sh`! This makes it easier for authors that don't know
what `nsjail` is.
