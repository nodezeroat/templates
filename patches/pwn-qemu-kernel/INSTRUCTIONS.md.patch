+# pwn-qemu-kernel template
+
+## TLDR
+
+- You get an SSH connection to a qemu machine
+- You have an unprivileged user shell
+- `/flag.txt` is owned by root
+
+Everything runs in qemu, so you can tweak the kernel or add custom modules for
+the privilege escalation.
+
+## Buildroot & Kernel
+
+You have to manually precompile them. Building them is too complex for including
+it in the template logic.
+
+You have makefiles available that pre-do most of the work.
+
+- The rootfs has to be in `qcow2` format, by default we use buildroot to build it.
+- The kernel is taken from `bzImage`. Default is 6.10.2
+- A custom module in `challenge/module/module.ko` is loaded at startup
+
+## Before the CTF
+
+### Port range
+
+Increase the range:
+
+```sh
+export PUBPORTSTART  = 20000
+export PUBPORTEND    = 20035
+```
+
+as every port is a seat for a player.
+
+Making it very big doesn't work in docker, as it spawns a process per forwarded
+port. Podman allocates it on-request. Kubernetes works.
+
+So for testing, keep the range low. For deployment increase it.
+
+If you have control over the allocated ports in the system (simple VPS with
+nothing else running) then you can deploy it with podman (quadlets) with `make
+deploy-quadlet` and a very big range
+
+### Proof of Work
+
+Consider adding proof of work (see `addon-proof-of-work`), just call it at the
+start of `entrypoint.sh` and exit if non-zero status is returned.
